# euler

This is my header-only library for mathematical utilities. Very useful for Project Euler but much of the code is also useful more broadly.

## Dependencies

- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)
- [primecount](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primecount)

## How to use

Simple as:

```cpp
#include <euler.hpp>
```

Check out `test/` for some sample code.
